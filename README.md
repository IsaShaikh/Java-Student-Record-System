# 🗃️ Student Record Management System

A clean, efficient **CLI-based CRUD application** to manage student records using **Java** and **ArrayList**.

This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming concepts like **Encapsulation**, **Data Structures (ArrayList)**, and **real-world CRUD operations** — implemented with optimized code structure and minimal time complexity.

## 🔍 OOP Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept         | Where It's Used                                       |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Encapsulation   | Private fields with getters/setters in `Book`, `User` |
| Inheritance     | Can be extended for `Librarian`, `Admin`, etc.        |
| Abstraction     | `Library` exposes only relevant methods to main       |
| Polymorphism    | Future enhancements can override behaviors            |
| Composition     | Library **has-a** Book and **has-a** User             |

## 💡 Future Enhancements



- 📂 Save data to files or a database

- 🌐 Add a GUI interface with JavaFX/Swing

- 🔒 Add authentication \& roles (Librarian, Admin)

- 📊 Track borrow history and due dates
